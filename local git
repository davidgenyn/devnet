PS C:\gitta> git checkout 62d6ae5
Note: switching to '62d6ae5'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 62d6ae5 text.txt was changed

PS C:\gitta> git checkout master
Warning: you are leaving 1 commit behind, not connected to
any of your branches:

  3fd1d56 experimental change

If you want to keep it by creating a new branch, this may be a good time
to do so with:

 git branch <new-branch-name> 3fd1d56

Switched to branch 'master'
